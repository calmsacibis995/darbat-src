 Iguana is designed as a base for the provision of operating system
 (OS) services for embedded systems. Among others, it provides
 the underlying OS for `Wombat <http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/software/kenge/wombat/latest/>`_, 
 our version of paravirtualised `Linux <http://www.kernel.org>`_ designed
 to provide legacy support for embedded systems. To get started playing
 with it read our `getting started <getting_started.pml>`_ page. For
