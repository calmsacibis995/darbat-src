/**
 * Driver for i8259 PIC
 * @param base	the base address of the registers
 *
 * The template parameter BASE enables compile-time resolution of the
 * PIC's control register addresses.
 *
 * Note:
 *   Depending on whether I8259_CACHE_PICSTATE is defined or not
 *   objects will cache the mask register or not. Thus it is not wise
 *   to blindly instanciate them all over the place because the cached
 *   state would not be shared. Making the cached state static
 *   wouldn't work either because there are two PICs in a
 *   PC99. Intended use is a single object per PIC.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - BASE can be passed as port to in_u8/out_u8
 * - The PIC's A0=0 register is located at BASE
 * - The PIC's A0=1 register is located at BASE+1
 * - PICs in unbuffered cascade mode
 *
 * Uses:
 * - out_u8, in_u8
