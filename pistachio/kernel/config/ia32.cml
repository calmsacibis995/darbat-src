# IA-32 specific kernel configurations
#

IA32_SMALL_SPACES	'Small address spaces' text
Small address spaces is an optimization that emulates tagged TLBs (and
tagged virtual caches in general) using the segmentation facility in
the IA-32 processors.  It can greatly reduce the costs associated with
address space switching.

#
# IA-32 specific debug configurations
#

IA32_KEEP_LAST_BRANCHES	'Keep last branch' text
Keep the state of the last-branch model specific registers upon
exceptions and enter kdebug instructions.  Useful for seeing where the
last branch occured in user level (e.g., where a branch to an invalid
instruction occured).

Enabling this will incur some overhead during exception/interrupt
handling.
