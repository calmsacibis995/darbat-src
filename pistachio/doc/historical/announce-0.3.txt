Subject: ANNOUNCE: L4Ka::Pistachio version 0.3

The L4Ka team is pleased to announce the availability of
L4Ka::Pistachio version 0.3.  The current release fixes a number of
bugs from the previous release and makes the following major changes:

   o The IA32 port now supports small address spaces.
   o The `high' field in memory descriptors now specify the last byte
     of the memory region (API change).
   o The way that the IA32 port invokes the system call stubs in the
     user-level bindings has changed.  The change requires that all
     applications that are compiled with the new bindings must also
     be linked with the new libl4 library.

L4Ka::Pistachio implements the L4 Version 4 API and currently supports
the following hardware architectures:

   o Intel IA32 (Pentium and higher)
   o Intel IA64 (Itanium1, Itanium2)
   o PowerPC 32bit (IBM 750)
   o Alpha (21164)
   o MIPS 64bit (R4000, R5000)

For more information on L4Ka::Pistachio and the L4 Version 4 API in
general, refer to the L4Ka::Pistachio whitepaper:
