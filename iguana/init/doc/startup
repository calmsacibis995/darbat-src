This init system is now scripted using lua.

iguana/init/src/startup.lua.template is the base startup script. It is
a template that is compiled to "startup.lua" which is then saved in
the dite and interpretted at startup by init.

The use of the template is to allow the correct example to be
started. The template language is fairly straight forward:

Conditionally produce output based on status of 'x':

{{if x:
<output>
if}}

Include the value of variable `example' in the output:

print("Loading {{?example}}")

The values of the variable are controlled from iguana/init/SConstruct.
