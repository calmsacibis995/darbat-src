ktrace - MACH_PRIVATE only function headers?  Apple API private?

MAXNAMLEN defines in ufs and isofs clash. They are the same, but this sux.


insque and remque collide in osfmk and bsd in the kern_sync.c file.
I took out the osfmk ones, but I dunno if that'll work good...

__OSAbsoluteTimePtr is in ...
#include <libkern/OSBase.h>

memset is in
#include <string.h>

IOInterruptHandler is in
#include <IOKit/IOPlatformExpert.h>


Whatever happens the mach_vm_* and vm_* all seem to want to be in the same 
header file?

For some reason is_suser() is in vm/vm_protos.h ???


WTF is a wait_queue_sub?!


panic is in
#include <kern/debug.h>

PE_boot_args is in
#include <igcompat/compat.h>

OSAddAtomic in
#include <libkern/OSAtomic.h>



Don't even think that sysctl's will work - especially machine dep. ones.
Nor uipc_domains
Nor pseudo device inits
Nor vlan or 'bond' interfaces
vnode_pager has been disabled


Finding stuff
-------------

Filesystem config table (vfsconflist) is in bsd/vfs/vfs_conf.c

Block device config table (bdevsw) is in bsd/dev/i386/conf.c but it's empty!



TODO
----

* Work out how to page in Iguana (ugh)

* Find where the vm_object is constructed during the whole named creation guy

* Implement our own vm_object struct to cope with it all.


------

Done:

Impl. some system calls

Files are all memory mapped VM

Trying to get (read-only) files from the file system

Hacking/paging Iguana

~~~~~~~~~~~~  Mach VM  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

vm_external_module is hacked out for now

How important is the MP model? 
	-- currently ignoring osfmk/i386/cpu.c

vm_map_pmap_is_empty -- disabled until we have more better pmap support


~~~~~~~~~~~~  HFS  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

What the hell is a '\p' character??


~~~~~~~~~~~~  Mach Threads & Tasks  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Could be salvageable? Hard to say...

The way init started is odd... why post AST_BSD as a flag and 
do the bsdinit_task on thread_resume? Why not do it eagerly?



~~~~~~~~~~~~  Getting up to Iguana Release  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Elf32 junk (fork elf32?)
* assert.c fix


~~~~~~~~~~~~  Multi-threaded kernel  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

* commpage_populate is disabled? ask Tom?
