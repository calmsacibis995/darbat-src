put task_importance in igcompat/src/hacks.c to do nothing
hacked vm_map to pass the actual pmap (grep for TGB), this will need to be reverted once chuck fixes reverse-lookups on pmaps
commented out a call to "machine_thread_set_state" in thread.c, as is this is hard to do

* need to implement reference/dirty bits
    done a bit, need to fix up the remove and protect routines, also the ones that do mappings
* need to implement pmap reference counting and destroying
* batch L4_Unmaps for certain pmap operations
* less crap stubs (fix up kernel side)
* fix commpage ugliness
* fix ncurses
