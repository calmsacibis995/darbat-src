.SH NAME
genext2fs \- ext2 filesystem generator for embedded systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B genext2fs
.RI [ options ]  " image"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgenext2fs\fP generates an ext2 filesystem
as a normal (non-root) user. It doesn't require you to mount
the image file to copy files on it. It doesn't even require
you to be the superuser to make device nodes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI -x \ image
Use this image as a starting point
.TP
.BI -d \ directory
Add this directory as source
.TP
.BI -f \ file
Add nodes (e.g. devices) from this spec file
.TP
.BI -b \ blocks
Size in blocks
.TP
.BI -i \ inodes
Number of inodes
.TP
.BI -r \ reserved
Number of reserved blocks
.TP
.BI -g \ path
Generate a block map file for this path
.TP
.BI -e \ value
Fill unallocated blocks with value
.TP
.BI -z
Make files with holes
.TP
.BI -v
Print resulting filesystem structure
.TP
.BI -h
Display help
.TP
.SH EXAMPLES

.EX
.B
 genext2fs -b 1440 -d src /dev/fd0
.EE

All files in the 
.I src
directory will be written to 
.B /dev/fd0
as a new ext2 filesystem image. You can then mount the floppy as
usual.

.EX
.B
 genext2fs -b 1024 -d src -f dev.txt flashdisk.img
.EE

This example builds a filesystem from all the files in 
.I src
, then device nodes are created based on the contents of the device file
.I dev.txt.
An example device file follows:

.EX
 drwx            /dev
 crw-    10,190  /dev/lcd
 brw-    1,0     /dev/ram0
.EE

This device list builds the /dev directory, a character device
node /dev/lcd (major 10, minor 190) and a block device node
/dev/ram0 (major 1, minor 0)
.SH BUGS
\fBgenext2fs\fP has been designed for embedded
systems. As such, it will generate a filesystem for single-user
usage: all files/directories/etc... will belong to UID/GID 0

\fBgenext2fs\fP does not support hard links.  Hard links present in the input
tree will be represented as separate files in the ext2 image.
