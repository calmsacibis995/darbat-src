Description: ext2 filesystem generator for embedded systems
 `genext2fs' is meant to generate an ext2 filesystem
 as a normal (non-root) user. It doesn't require you to mount
 the image file to copy files on it. It doesn't even require
 you to be the superuser to make device nodes.
 .
 Warning ! `genext2fs' has been designed for embedded
 systems. As such, it will generate a filesystem for single-user
 usage: all files/directories/etc... will belong to UID/GID 0
