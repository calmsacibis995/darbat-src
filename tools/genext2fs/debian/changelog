genext2fs (1.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * - Compile with -O2.
    - get_workblk() should return zero'd memory.  This way we get
      nul terminations in the produced image.
    - get_workblk() now allocates the block dynamically on the heap.
      The previous method of allocating the block as 'static' apparently
      results in undefined behavior since get_workblk() is 'inline'.
    Thanks to Vincent Sanders <vince@debian.org> for the patch.
    (closes: #248987)
