 The todo list is now.
   - better man pages for the COUNTRY stuff
   - test writing with xdf disks
   - man pages for xdf stuff (shouldn't be too tough)
   - various transfer size optimisation (right now, most read/write routines
   use the minimal possible transfer size :-( )
   - code to enable suns to access xdf and 2m disks :-)

 Volunteers appreciated, especially for the first 3 items.
