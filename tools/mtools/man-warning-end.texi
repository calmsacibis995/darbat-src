Mtools' texinfo doc
@unnumbered Viewing the texi doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

@itemize @bullet
@item
To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following
commands:
@example
    ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi
@end example

@item
To generate a html copy,  run:
@example
    ./configure; make html
@end example
A premade html can be found at:
@file{http://mtools.linux.lu}
and also at:
@file{http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools}

@item
To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:
@example
    ./configure; make info
@end example
@end itemize

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
