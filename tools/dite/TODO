These aren't in any real order ... 

{1}
- Open, low
* aclocal.m4, configure 
@ Fix up the CVS archive so that commit only commits human-generated files
 (i.e. drop aclocal and friends).

@ Add coff support

{3}
- Open, high
* 
@ Test whether it works with MIPS.

{4}
- Open, medium
* elf32.c

 a single file which actually does the dirty stuff).
 
{5}
- Open, high
* README, INSTALL
@ Actually make these non-breaindead to read, and useful.  Might also add
some documentation on the internals of dite (so people can modify it if they
want ... not that difficult to understand from code tho.)

{6}
- Open, high
*
@ Change the names to dite from edit ;)
