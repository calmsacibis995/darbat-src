Templating philosophy

- The templates are there to mark-up pre-specified data in a given format
- They should be simple. Ideally they should do no processing.

This means that the templates are not very flexible. This is very much by design. If you need to perform complicated processing, write it in Python, in the generator.

The reason for this is so we avoid hiding arcana about the output in the templates.
