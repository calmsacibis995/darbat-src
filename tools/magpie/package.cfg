ShortDescription:

 threads to communicate via a well-defined interface specified in a subset of 
 OMG (CORBA) IDL.

Description: 
 Magpie is an interface compiler for the L4 kernel. It makes communication 
 via L4 IPC simpler and more reliable by providing stub code that allows two 
 threads to communicate via a well-defined interface specified in a subset of 
 OMG (CORBA) IDL.

 Magpie is an experimental system written with the aim of
 finding a fast, efficient, malleable interface compiler. Its
 main advantage in support of this goal is currently in its
 support for template-driven code generation. This is not a new
 technique, but is rather uncommon in interface compilers.

 Other reasons to use Magpie include its optimised ARM support
 and its continued, active development. Magpie has been in
 production use since late 2004.  

 Magpie is developed using the `Magpie Wiki <http://lardcave.net/~wzdd/hype/doku.php?id=magpie:start>`_.
