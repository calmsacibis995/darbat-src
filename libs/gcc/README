README libgcc

This project is NOT meant to be explicitly exported.  None of these
functions are meant to be explicitly used.  These are the functions
that are included with libgcc, but cannot use the original version
due to static/dynamic library incompatibility.

You are required to include this library in your list of libraries to link,
however, if gcc implicitly emits code that makes use of these functions.

These functions originate from the NetBSD operating system, in 
sys/libkern, and are thus under the BSD license, not the GNU 
General Public License as would usually be the case for someone who
uses the libgcc bundled with gcc.

This package is, of course, not complete in any way.  Things are 
added "on demand", i.e., when they are required.  The best place to 
pull them in would be from the NetBSD operating system.
