 * IOBlockStorageDevice
 * @abstract
 * A generic block storage device abstraction.
 * @discussion
 * The IOBlockStorageDevice class exports the generic block storage protocol,
 * independent of the physical connection protocol (e.g. SCSI, ATA, USB),
 * forwarding all requests to its provider (the Transport Driver).
 * Though the nub does no actual processing of requests, it is necessary
 * in a C++ environment. The Transport Driver can be of any type, as
 * long as it inherits from IOService. Because Transport Drivers needn't
 * derive from a type known to IOBlockStorageDriver, it isn't possible for
 * IOBlockStorageDriver to include the appropriate header file to allow direct
 * communication with the Transport Driver. Thus we achieve polymorphism by 
 * having the Transport Driver instantiate a subclass of IOBlockStorageDevice.
 * A typical implementation for a concrete subclass of IOBlockStorageDevice
 * simply relays all methods to its provider (the Transport Driver), which
 * implements the protocol- and device-specific behavior.
 * 
 * All pure-virtual functions must be implemented by the Transport Driver, which
 * is responsible for instantiating the Nub.
