/*! @class IOCardBusDevice
    @abstract Class that represents a 32-bit CardBus device.
    @discussion <b>Introduction</b>    

After the discovery of a 32-bit PC Card, the PC Card Family creates
and publishes an instance of the IOCardBusDevice provider nub.

The same driver should work for CardBus cards and PCI cards in most
cases.  For more information on writing CardBus drivers please refer
to the documentation for writing PCI device drivers.  It is recommended
that CardBus drivers list their provider as IOPCIDevice instead of
IOCardBusDevice to avoid having to pull in the PC Card Family if it is
not required.

CardBus cards can be shut down from the menu bar or physically
ejected.  The driver will first receive a Card Services event through
its message method before being terminated.  If your driver can handle
being unloaded by using the shell command "kextunload" it should also
be ready and able to handle being ejected.
    
<b>Types of Driver Matching Supported by IOCardBusDevice</b>

Matching is done by comparing the driver's matching properties against
information retrieved from the Configuration Space and its CIS
information.  In addition to what is provided by IOService and
IOPCIDevice, the following matching is also supported:

<b>"VersionOneInfo"</b>

The "VersionOneInfo" property match is based on the CISTPL_VERS_1
tuple.  It matches against an array of strings, where each string is
one of the entries from the version one tuple.  Trailing entries that are
omitted from the driver's matching entry are treated as wild matches.
