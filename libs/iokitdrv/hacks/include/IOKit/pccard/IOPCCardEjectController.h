    @abstract Skeleton class for supporting software-controlled PC Card ejection mechanisms.
    @discussion  This is an optional skeleton class that you may subclass if you wish to support a software-controlled PC Card ejection mechanism and/or software-controlled card socket ejection buttons.  There should be an instance of your subclassed driver attached to the CardBus Controller's provider for each socket.  The CardBus bridge driver, IOPCCardBridge, uses the matching category "IOPCCardEjectController" to find this driver and call it.  This class is both responsible for receiving external requests for ejections, such as platform-specific eject buttons, and for the execution of the actual software initiated ejection.
