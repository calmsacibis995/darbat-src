/*! @class IOPCCard16Device
    @abstract Class that represents a 16-bit PC Card device.
    @discussion <b>Introduction</b>    

After the discovery of a 16-bit PC Card, the PC Card Family creates
and publishes an instance of the IOPCCard16Device provider nub.
This nub provides the driver with methods to handle card
initialization, simplified memory and I/O window management, and
access to Card Services.

Typically, drivers that attach to the IOPCCard16Device nub will either
subclass from another IOKit family or directly from IOService.  The
IOPCCard16Device class is not meant to be subclassed.

Writing drivers for 16-bit PC Cards should be very similar to writing
drivers for PCI or CardBus devices.  The main difference is that a
card's configuration will also need to be selected before the card can
be used.  Once the configuration is selected, the mapping of register windows works exactly as with PCI or CardBus device.  Most
drivers should never need to make a Card Services call to support their
card.

The IOPCCard16Device class defers much of its work to an instance of
IOPCCard16Enabler class.  The enabler does the work of finding,
ordering, reserving, and enabling possible card configurations.  It
handles the details of requesting and releasing individual elements of
that configuration from Card Services.  The PC Card Family provides a
default enabler that should handle most cards.  The default enabler is
automatically installed for you.

During sleep, PC Cards are completely powered off.  When power is
returned, cards are automatically reconfigured and left in basically the
same state as if the configure method had just been called.  The
driver is responsible for saving any additional card state across this
power management event or it can just reinitialize the card from scratch.
The driver should also protect itself at this time from outside events
and try to avoid touching the hardware.  Typical events include: user
requests, spurious interrupts, timer events, card ejection events, ...

When cards are powered down from the menu bar or physically ejected,
the driver will first receive a Card Services event through its
message method before being terminated. Power management events are
handled in the usual IOKit manner.

<b>Types of Driver Matching Supported by IOPCCard16Device</b>

Matching is done by comparing the driver's matching properties against
information retrieved from the PC Card's CIS information.  In addition to
what is provided by IOService, the following types of matching are
supported:

<b>"IONameMatch"</b>

The "IONameMatch" property matches the name give by the PC Card Bridge
driver to a card's driver.  Normally, this name will be of the form
"pccardX,Y", where X is the manufacturer ID and Y is the card ID.
Both IDs are taken from the tuple CISTPL_MANFID.

If the card has no CIS on it, the name will be "pccard-no-cis".  If
the card has CIS but it does not have the CISTPL_MANFID tuple the name
will be "pccard-no-manfid".

<b>"VersionOneInfo"</b>

The "VersionOneInfo" property match is based on the CISTPL_VERS_1
tuple.  It matches against an array of strings, where each string is
one of the entries from the version one tuple.  Trailing entries that are
omitted from the driver's matching entry are treated as wild matches.

<b>"FunctionName"</b>

The "FunctionName" property match is based on the CISTPL_FUNCID tuple.
The following function type strings are supported:

	"Multi-Function", "Memory", "Serial Port", "Parallel Port",
	"Fixed Disk", "Video Adapter", "Network Adapter", "AIMS",
	"SCSI", "Security", "Instrument", "Vendor-Specific", "Anonymous"

The "Anonymous" string is used if no CIS information was found on the card.	

<b>"FunctionID"</b>

The "FunctionID" property match is is also based on the CISTPL_FUNCID tuple.
Instead of looking for a string, it matches on the actual ID number.

<b>"VendorID"</b>

The "VendorID" property match is based on the manufacturer ID in the
CISTPL_MANFID tuple.

<b>"DeviceID"</b>

The "DeviceID" property match is based on the device ID in the CISTPL_MANFID tuple.

<b>"MemoryDeviceName"</b>

The "MemoryDeviceName" property match is based on the CISTPL_DEVICE
and CISTPL_DEVICE_A tuples.  It matches against the following memory
types:

	"ROM", "OTPROM", "EPROM", "EEPROM", "Flash",
	"SRAM",	"DRAM",	"Function Specific", "Extended"
