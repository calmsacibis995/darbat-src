 * Apple16X50UARTTypes.h
 * Determine what type of UART is present, determine it's capabilities such as FIFO depth
 * and Master Clock frequency, and verify that it is working as expected.  These routines
 * are expected to be called prior to Apple16X50UARTSync::start(), and so they take
 * liberties with the UART registers that would probably cause problems if called while
 * the port is open and/or active.  XXX - lots more to do here; this driver needs to be
 * aware of a great many more UART variants, and should actually test the FIFO size
 * and FIFO trigger levels, since they vary from vendor to vendor.
