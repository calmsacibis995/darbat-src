    // Some functions to talks to the DevaSys  <http://www.devasys.com> "USB I2C/IO,  Interface Board"
    // These come in 2 flavors DevaFuncName and DevaFuncNameD. The two sets are functionally identical
    // but take either a device (USBDeviceInterface) object (the "D" functions 
    // or an Interface (USBInterfaceInterface) object to work on. 
    //
    // Currently defined functions are:
    // 
    //    IOReturn DevaSetIoPortsConfig(IOUSBDeviceInterface **dev, UInt32 portBits);
    //    IOReturn DevaReadIoPorts(IOUSBDeviceInterface **dev, UInt32 *portBits);
    //    IOReturn DevaWriteIoPorts(IOUSBDeviceInterface **dev, UInt32 portBits, UInt32 mask);
    // 
    // The operate on the 20 programmable IO bits which appear on the IO connector.
    // The port bits are mapped as 0x000CBBAA (with the 4 C bits shifted down 4 bits)
    // 
    // DevaSetIoPortsConfig sets the 20 programmable IO ports to either Input or Output.
    // Bits which are 0 are configured as output, bits which are 1 are configured as
    // Input. (Mneumonic, 0 looks like 'O', 1 looks like "I".)
    // 
    // DevaReadIoPorts reads the state of the IO pins. The state of both inputs and
    // outputs are read. Outputs should reflect the state they were last set to
    // (unless you have an horrendous load on them.)
    // 
    // DevaWriteIoPorts sets the state of any output bits. Only bits which have
    // their corresponding mask bit set are affected, and of course only bits
    // which had previously been configured as output can do anything.
    // 
    // if you set the symbol NARRATEIO to non zero, a message will be printed  for
    // every IO attempt.
