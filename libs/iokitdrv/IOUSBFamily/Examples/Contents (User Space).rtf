\f0\b\fs72 \cf0 Mac OS X USB User Space Sample Code
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\
This directory contains three example XCode projects for writing USB drivers which operate in User Space.\
\

\fs48 USBSimpleExample\

\fs24 \
This project shows the basics of how to connect to and communicate with a USB device from User Space. It is written as a standard Unix tool.\
\
\

\fs48 USBNotificationExample\

\fs24 \
This project shows how to use the IOKit notification mechanism to register to be notified when devices come and go. It uses the Cypress/Anchor EZ-USB chip. (Look at the following example for another way to get notified when a device is unplugged).\
\

\fs48 Another USB Notification Example\

\fs24 \
Another sample that demonstrates how to use IOKitLib and IOUSBLib to set up asynchronous  callbacks when a USB device is attached to or removed from the system is located at:\

\cf0 It also shows how to associate arbitrary data with each device instance (which can be used to distinguish between identical devices).\
