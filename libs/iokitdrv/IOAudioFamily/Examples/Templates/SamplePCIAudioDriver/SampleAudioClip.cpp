// The function clipOutputSamples() is called to clip and convert samples from the float mix buffer into the actual
// hardware sample buffer.  The samples to be clipped, are guaranteed not to wrap from the end of the buffer to the
// beginning.
// This implementation is very inefficient, but illustrates the clip and conversion process that must take place.
// Each floating-point sample must be clipped to a range of -1.0 to 1.0 and then converted to the hardware buffer
// format

// The parameters are as follows:
//		mixBuf - a pointer to the beginning of the float mix buffer - its size is based on the number of sample frames
// 					times the number of channels for the stream
//		sampleBuf - a pointer to the beginning of the hardware formatted sample buffer - this is the same buffer passed
//					to the IOAudioStream using setSampleBuffer()
//		firstSampleFrame - this is the index of the first sample frame to perform the clipping and conversion on
//		numSampleFrames - the total number of sample frames to clip and convert
//		streamFormat - the current format of the IOAudioStream this function is operating on
//		audioStream - the audio stream this function is operating on
