All of these drivers, I took the version out of their directories.

They correspond to the ones from 10.4.2.

Except for:

IOATABlockStorage (10.3, nowhere to be found for 10.4)
IOSCSI.* blah balh (10.3, 404 for 10.4)
IOUSBFamily (snagged these from 10.4.4)
IOUSBFamily: removed pragma pack from there.  Instead, used alignment=1
