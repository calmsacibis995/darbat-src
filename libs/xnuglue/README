Thie library implements the required xnu emulation.  This is required
because we do not want to change the I/O Kit's Mach dependencies, yet
we do not wish to make use of Mach.  (The I/O Kit now lives in a separate
protection domain to Mach/BSD in L4IOKit).

In xnu, the different components are compiled separately with separate
defines.  In xnu_glue, we do not do this.  This is obviously a little
broken, and we should, since the defines hide certain things and 
define others differently.  This may or may not be revisited in the future.
